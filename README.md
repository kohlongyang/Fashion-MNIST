# Fashion-MNIST 
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset based on the assortment of products on a German retailing companyâ€™s website, Zalando. The dataset comprises 28 by 28 grayscale images of 70 000 fashion products from 10 classes. The training set has 60 000 images and the test set has 10 000.  There are 10 classes total: T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, ankle boot. The data samples are uniformly split between the ten classes for both training and test sets.

The 28 by 28 pixels of each image are represented by the 784 features, with values ranging from 0 to 255 to indicate the brightness of the pixel - 0 taken as black and 255 taken as white.


In this project, we wish to explore and evaluate various approaches which use a variety of supervised learning algorithms to classify the products and find an approach best suited for image classification. 
* Preprocessing of data using PCA
* kNN
* SVM
* CNN
